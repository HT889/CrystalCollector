#Crystal Collector

#How to play

A random number is generated between 19-120 at the start of the game. There are also four crystals. Each crystal is assigned a random number between 1-12. The value of the crystals is hidden from the player.

Every time you click on a crystal, the crystals value is added to your total score. You must match your total score with the random number that was generated at the start of the game (between 19-120) to win the game. If you go over, you lose!

All values are reset after a win/loss.
